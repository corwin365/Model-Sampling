%containing fields:
%Lon   - 1d. Runs from -180 to +180
%Lat   - 1d
%Time  - 1d
%Prs   - 1d
%T     - 4d, time x lon x lat x pressure


%first, compute an average pressure scale
%we're in the stratosphere, and have much bigger errors than thuis elsewhere
PrsScale = squeeze(nanmean(nanmean(Data.p,1),2));

%then, stick stuff in a struct
Model.Lon  = Data.longitude;
Model.Lat  = Data.latitude;
Model.Time = Data.time;
Model.T    = permute(Data.T,[4,1,2,3]);
Model.Prs  = PrsScale;

%CFSR runs from -180 to +180, so we don't need to fix the lons

%success!
